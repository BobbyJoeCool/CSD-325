# CSD-325
Advanced Python

## Module 1
10/20/2025 - 10/26/2025

In this module, we will review the basic elements of programming that were covered in one of your previous courses: CSD205 or CIS245.

You'll be creating a program that includes a function, looping, a sentinel value, an if/else statement and getting input from the user before the program is run. For each programming assignment, you'll also need to create a flowchart using standard shapes and notation. I've placed a tutorial in the reading section in case you need a little refresh on how to contruct flowcharts. You may use any app you'd like to create the charts as long as the result is copied/pasted into a Word doc, or saved as a .pdf. You'll also need to have Python installed. If you do not, there is a link in the reading to installation instructions.

### Discussion Board Topics
In this module's discussion board assignment, answer the following questions:

1) Which IDE did you use for the last Python course? Will you use it again? Why or why not?
2) What resource did/will you use the most for programming issues? Why this one?
3) Using the Pragmatic Programmer reading assignment, select one (1) topic and complete the following:
    - Why did you select this topic?
    - Summarize the main points (in your own words) of that topic in three or four sentences.
    - Find at least one additional resource (video, book, article, website, etc.) that supports your summary. Write an additional 1-2 sentences. Include a link to that resource.

### Assignments
#### Assignment 1.2
For this assignment, you will be creating a GitHub repository using git and the CLI. The repository you create in this assignment will be used throughout the course to host the coding assignments and flowcharts. If you have not already installed Git, please do so before continuing. Make sure that you complete the steps to set the global username and global email address.

There are resources available in the Git/GitHub Resources menu item to the left on installing and configuring Git.

**Instructions:**

1) Click on each instruction box below to expand the instructions.
2) Complete the setup instructions and save the following items into a single Word document that includes your name and assignment number at the top of the document:
    - Link to your GitHub repository
    - Screenshot of your GitHub repository
    - Screenshot of your local directory, following the structure format provided in the instructions below.

**Deliverables:**
1) Link to your GitHub repository.
2) Screenshot of your GitHub repository.
3) Screenshot of your local directory (properly formatted).
4) Combine all 3 items into a single Word document, place your name and assignment number on the first page, and title it <your-last-name>-<assignment-name> .docx.

#### Assignment 1.3
For this assignment, you have two tasks. The first is to create a flowchart (or flowcharts) for the following requirements, then to write a Python program that produces the required results:

If you are not familiar with the reverse counting song "100 bottles of beer on the wall", you'll need to do a little research to familiarize yourself with it.

- Ask the user how many bottles of beer are on the wall.
- Pass that input to a function that manages the countdown.
- The function should take the input and count backwards to 1 while displaying the number of remaining bottles of beer on the wall.
- Once the count is down to 1, change lyrics to show "1 bottle of beer..."
- At the end of the countdown, get back to the main program and remind the user to buy more beer.

**Deliverables:**
1) Open up a drawing application. Use a text element to include your name and assignment number at the top of the drawing. Before continuing, you might view the Flowchart and Structures video listed in the Module Reading area. Then, create a flowchart that models the above process.  Copy/paste the diagram into a Word document and save to your module-1 directory.
2) Create a Python program that addresses the requirements of the process above. Save the file to your module-1 directory.

## Module 2
10/20/2025 - 10/26/2025

In this module, we will be working on debugging, something that we all must do at some point!

You'll be stepping through a provided tutorial for debugging using an IDE, but the same steps can be used with the pdb module from the Python standard library. Breakpoints, stepping in, stepping over, stepping out, and continuing are some of the more common actions to take when debugging. Many IDEs do aid when searching for syntax errors, but finding logic errors are a little more problematic.

### Deliverables
1) Module 2.1 Discussion Board Initial Post - Due by Thursday 11:59 p.m., CT.
2) Discussion Board Responses - Due by Sunday 11:59 p.m., CT.
3) Module 2.2 Assignment: Documented Debugging - Due by Sunday 11:59 p.m., CT.

### Discussion Board
In this module's discussion board assignment, answer the following questions:

1) Using the Pragmatic Programmer reading assignment, select one (1) topic and complete the following:
    - Why did you select this topic?
    - Summarize the main points (in your own words) of that topic in three or four sentences.
    - Find at least one additional resource (video, book, article, website, etc.) that supports your summary. Write an additional 1-2 sentences. Include a link to that resource.

### Assignments
#### Assignment 2.2
For this assignment, you have three tasks. The first is find a program that you've written, or find an example online that contains at least one function, you'll then need to create a flowchart (or flowcharts) for the program, then capture debugging activity on the program.

1) Create (if you haven't already) a directory in CSD-325 named module-2.
2) Look through programs you've created from previous classes, (or do a little research and find an example of a program) that contains a least one function.
3) Open up a drawing application. Use a text element to include your name and assignment number at the top of the drawing. Create a flowchart that models the program you selected.  Copy/paste the diagram into a Word document and save to your module-2 directory.
4) Open the Debugging Guide from the reading material for this module and follow through the steps. You might want to practice them first..
5) Open your program in an IDE and use the debugging tools, **OR** read through the tutorial at [Debugging in Python](https://www.codementor.io/@gbozee/debugging-in-python-9ia7lof32) (Abiola, codementor.io, 2017) and use the Python module for debugging.
6) Create a Word document and put your name and assignment number on the first page.
7) Back in the IDE, create a break point, and start the debugging process, take a screenshot of your progress and paste into the Word document.
8) Step into the function, and take a screenshot of the current location and paste it into the Word document.
9) Use at least one more action in the code, either adding errors, or moving through the program and take a screenshot of the progress and paste into the Word document.
10) Save the Word document, with at least three screenshots, into the CSD/CSD-325/module-2 directory.
11) Save the Python program into the CSD/CSD-325/module-2 directory.
